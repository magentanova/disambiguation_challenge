| Prompt:                                                                                                                           |
| Write software that takes in unidentified journal articles (asset-test.json) and idenitites (identity-test.json) and              |
| outputs a file that gives each one of those identities the articles that belong to it. Please take a look at training-data.json   |
| to see what sample output should look like.                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                   |
| Things to Keep in mind:                                                                                                           |
| 1. Just because a article has a person with the same name, doesn't necessarilly make it a match. Multiple people can have the     |
|    same name.                                                                                                                     |
| 2. This problem is not expected to be completely solved with even near 100% recall and precision in 2 hours. It is what our team  |
|    has been working on for months. We are just looking to see how you would approach this problem in a very limited time-frame.   |
|                                                                                                                                   |
